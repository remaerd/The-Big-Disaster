**Set Up:**

This is a game for 2 - 4 players.

Each player starts with 2 random **Progress Cards.**

The **Progress Deck** should contain one of each type of **Progress Card** for each player. For example, if there are only 2 players there needs to be two fire cards and two metal cards etc.

To win the player needs to collect one of each type of **Progress Card.**

The length of the game can be adjusted by lowering the amount of Progress Card **types** needed to win to a **minimum** of six.

In long games where the players need 8 or 9 types to win, each player gets 3 **Repair Cards.**

In ****short games where the players need 6 or 7 types to win, each player gets 2 **Repair Cards.**

Note that the players in this game **show** their hand of cards.

**How to play:**

To begin, all the players roll a D6; the player with the highest roll goes first.

When the turn begins the player pulls a card from the Disaster Deck. The card pulled from this deck will have a number on it. This number indicates how high the player must roll on a D6 to beat the Disaster Card. ****

Now the player must make one of two choices:

They may roll a D6 to try to beat the value on the Disaster Card. If they succeed in this roll they may discard the Disaster Card and draw a Progress Card. If the player chooses to roll the D6 and they fail to beat the number listed, they will be forced to discard one of their Progress Cards along with the Disaster Card.

**Note:** If a player has 2 less Progress Cards than any other player, they draw 2 Progress Cards after a successful disaster roll.

They may **Instead** play a Repair Card ****to immediately discard the Disaster Card. ****If the player chooses this option they may **NOT** draw a Progress Card.

**After** the disaster has been discarded, the player may discard 2 of their Progress Cards in order to draw a new one. OR the player may choose to use two of their Progress Cards to **battle** another player.

How to **battle**: The player bids two Progress Cards. They then select a card held by another player. Both players roll a D6, the player that rolls the highest gains all the cards used in the battle. If the dice rolls are the same, both players reroll.

**Note** that all Progress Cards are placed at the bottom of the Progress Deck when they are discarded.

Repair Trading: When another player has drawn a Disaster Card, any player can offer one of their Repair Cards to them. This must be done before the player rolls the D6. If the player accepts the Repair Card, the player that gifted the card draws a Progress Card.

Once the Disaster Deck has been used up, reshuffle it into a new deck. Or the Disaster Cards can be placed at the bottom of the deck when they are discarded.

**If a player loses ALL of their Progress Cards, they are eliminated from the game!**
